<script>!function(){var n={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"WHAT IS LEASING AND WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Leasing a vehicle is effectively the same as renting it for a certain length of time, usually for two, three or four years. You choose the make and model of vehicle, how many miles you are going to drive each year and for how long you would like the contract to last. At the end of the leasing agreement, just hand the car back. You will not own the vehicle at the end of the lease.\n\nLeasing means you do not have to worry about the depreciation of the vehicle or disposing of it at the end of the contract.\n\nLeasing is now an increasingly popular and affordable way to drive a brand new car or van, as you are only paying for the initial payment and a monthly rental, you are not paying to actually own the vehicle. For that reason, initial payments are usually lower and monthly payments are often much more affordable than the expense of owning a car.\n\nWith leasing, you also benefit from manufacturers’ warranties; road tax is often included as well as breakdown recovery. You may also want to consider the option of including a monthly-paid maintenance package for complete hassle-free motoring.\n\nBusinesses may benefit from additional fleet support and fleet discounts, reduced administration costs and advantageous tax benefits."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"ARE THERE ANY FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN LEASING A VEHICLE?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"More and more people are leasing vehicles each year in the UK, and it is worth considering the key facts before you go ahead with your contract.\n\nExcess Mileage Charge\n\nIf you drive more miles than stipulated in your contract, excess mileage charges will apply. You will be made aware of what these charges are prior to going ahead with your contract. You will not receive any money back from the contract if you drive less miles than you predicted.\n\nServicing and Maintenance\n\nYou will be responsible for servicing and maintaining the vehicle to the manufacturer’s guidelines. This will ensure the warranty remains valid. Nash Automotive Automotive offers fixed price servicing, maintenance and tyres for an additional fee which can help spread the cost throughout the term of the lease.\n\nEnding My Contract Early\n\nDepending on the type of contract, you may be liable to pay an early termination charge.\n\nFair Wear and Tear\n\nYou cannot permanently customise the vehicle, although non-permanent accessories may be permitted. In addition, the terms of the lease agreement require the vehicle to be returned in a fair condition based on its age and mileage. The BVRLA ( British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association) provides an industry guide to fair returns standards. Nash Automotive Automotive and the majority of our leasing company partners work to these standards. You can find out more on the BVRLA website."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"IS VEHICLE ROAD TAX INCLUDED?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Depending on the type of leasing agreement you opt for, vehicle road tax will usually be included for either the first 12 months of the contract or the entire term. Your Account Manager will advise you on this prior to commitment to the leasing agreement."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"IS CAR INSURANCE INCLUDED?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In most cases, the answer is no. As part of the leasing agreement, it will be your responsibility to ensure that the car has fully comprehensive insurance for the length of the lease.\n\nOnce your car has been registered and we have a delivery date from the vehicle manufacturer, our Client Services Team will provide you with your new registration number so that you can arrange insurance to commence from the day of delivery. The delivery driver may want to see your insurance certificate before he can hand the vehicle over to you.\n\nIn certain circumstances we may be able to provide a vehicle which is fully insured. Please ask your Account Manager for details on this.\n\nWe are not authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for the sale of vehicle insurance."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"DO YOU PROVIDE GAP INSURANCE?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Nash Automotive Automotive does not offer GAP insurance."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"WHAT INSURANCE IS REQUIRED?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As part of the leasing agreement, you will need to ensure that the vehicle has fully comprehensive insurance for the entire contract term."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICING THE VEHICLE?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, all vehicles should be maintained and serviced in line with the manufacturer’s guidelines, as detailed in the vehicle handbook. In most cases, this can be done at your nearest main dealership or independent repairer using the correct parts, oils and lubricants.\n\nFor those with a maintenance plan, the majority of costs associated with servicing and mechanical repairs are included in your monthly payment. Maintenance plans vary by provider;your Account Manager will confirm what is included and what is not included at the quotation stage."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"WHAT IS “FAIR WEAR AND TEAR”?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The finance providers will expect your vehicle to be returned in line with their “Fair Wear and Tear” policy. Fair Wear and Tear occurs during normal use of the vehicle over time, but is different to damage, which will need to be rectified before the car is returned to avoid any charges from the leasing company.\n\nNash Automotive Automotive is a member of the BVRLA, the trade body for the vehicle rental and leasing sector, and you can find out more about “Fair Wear and Tear” by visiting the website:\n\nhttp://www.bvrla.co.uk/advice/guidance/returning-your-leased-vehicle"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"I DON’T KNOW WHAT MY YEARLY MILEAGE WILL BE…WHAT SHOULD I DO?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"There may be a number of reasons why you are unsure of your yearly mileage. For example, you may be changing roles, jobs or moving home, you could be given a different area of responsibility to work in or you may gain a new customer or business contact in a new area. Nash Automotive Car Leasing recommends looking at your distance mileage over the last two or three years and considering your personal circumstances and any other external factors which may affect how far you drive each year.\n\nOur team are experienced in these conversations and are happy to help you select the right mileage for your contract. It is important to note that excess charges apply in the event that you exceed the contracted mileage.\n\nIf you think you are going to exceed your annual mileage, or are driving less miles than you thought, please contact your Account Manager or our Client Services Team for advice."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I WANTED TO TERMINATE MY LEASE EARLY?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Lease agreements are fixed-term contracts therefore terminating them could mean you are liable to pay a charge and any excess mileage charges due at that point. Please contact your Account Manager or our Client Services Team for a quote."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"DOES MY VEHICLE COME WITH THE MANUFACTURER’S WARRANTIES?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, all new and pre-registered vehicles benefit from the manufacturer’s warranty. These may differ between brands. Please discuss this with your Account Manager who will be happy to provide the warranty details and benefits for the various makes and models."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"HOW IS THE RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE VEHICLE CALCULATED?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Leasing companies use a variety of factors to estimate the residual value of your vehicle at the end of the lease. This includes information from the vehicle manufacturer, auction prices and historical resale data as well as market trends and changes in tax legislation including, for example, CO2 tax and Benefit in Kind (BIK) tax.\n\n"}}]},e=document.createElement("script");e.type="application/ld+json",e.innerHTML=JSON.stringify(n),document.head.appendChild(e)}();</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"WHAT IS LEASING AND WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Leasing a vehicle is effectively the same as renting it for a certain length of time, usually for two, three or four years.

<h2 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">GENERAL LEASING INFORMATION</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What is leasing and what are the advantages?</span></h3>
<p>Leasing a vehicle is effectively a long-term rental for a set period of time, usually for two, three or four years. You choose the make and model of vehicle, how many miles you are going to drive each year and for how long you would like the contract to last. At the end of the leasing agreement, just hand the car back. You will not own the vehicle at the end of the lease.</p>
<p>Leasing means you do not have to worry about the depreciation of the vehicle or disposing of it at the end of the contract.</p>
<p>Leasing is now an increasingly popular and affordable way to drive a brand new car or van, as you are only paying for the initial payment and a monthly rental, you are not paying to actually own the vehicle. For that reason, initial payments are usually lower and monthly payments are often much more affordable than the expense of owning a car.</p>
<p>With leasing, you also benefit from manufacturers’ warranties; road tax is often included as well as breakdown recovery. You may also want to consider the option of including a monthly-paid maintenance package for complete hassle-free motoring.</p>
<p>Businesses may benefit from additional fleet support and fleet discounts, reduced administration costs and advantageous tax benefits.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Are there any further considerations to take into account when leasing a vehicle?</span></h3>
<p>More and more people are leasing vehicles each year in the UK, and it is worth considering the key facts before you go ahead with your contract.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Excess Mileage Charges</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you exceed your pre-agreed mileage allowance during the term of the leasing agreement, an Excess Mileage Charge will apply.�&nbsp; These are calculated as pence per mile.�&nbsp; Details of these charges are on your quote and your order form.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Early Termination Charges</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to end your leasing agreement early, this will be dependent on the terms and conditions of the agreement with your finance provider and type of contract. Early termination charges will apply and are usually between 50% and 100% of the outstanding contracted monthly rentals.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Non-Ownership Agreement</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For Personal Lease and Contract Hire agreements, you will not own the vehicle. This is simply a usage agreement. In some cases, the finance provider may make the vehicle available to purchase at the end of the agreement. This is at their discretion. We do offer contracts where ownership is an option. Please check before committing that the contract is suitable for your needs.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>End of Contract Charges</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The vehicle must be returned in line with the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) Fair Wear and Tear standards.�&nbsp; If not, damage and/or end of contract charges will apply.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Diesel Particulate Filter</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Is diesel right for me? If your vehicle has a diesel engine, it will be fitted with a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF).�&nbsp;�&nbsp; The DPF must be able to regenerate in order to function correctly.�&nbsp; During frequent short journeys, it may be difficult for the DPF to regenerate fully.�&nbsp; Regeneration is best done on motorway journeys or A-Roads for 30-50 minutes at a sustained speed (Source: RAC). If you do not do this type of driving regularly, you may wish to consider an alternative engine type. DPFs are not found in petrol, hybrid or electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Diesel vehicles also require Ad Blue/Exhaust Fluid. It is the driver’s responsibility to ensure this is kept topped up. Ad Blue is not part of a maintenance plan and is not covered under the manufacturer’s warranty.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Servicing/Maintenance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure your vehicle is serviced and maintained in line with the manufacturers’ guidelines. Maintenance plans are available for an additional fee which can help spread the cost throughout the term of the lease.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Road Tax / Vehicle Excise Duty (VED)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Road Tax is an excise duty applied to most types of vehicles that are driven on UK public roads. Your lease vehicle will come with its Road Tax paid for the duration of the contract and is renewed automatically. Road Tax is set by the government which may be subject to change which may be passed onto you during the term of the contract. There is no road tax applicable on fully Electric Cars currently, although this may change in the future.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Hybrid/Electric Cars</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are a number of external factors that affect the range of a hybrid/electric vehicle. These can include, but not limited to, outside temperature, cabin temperature, speed, terrain, acceleration, driving style and battery condition. Please remember that range provided by the manufacturers should be considered to be a guide only.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Insurance Requirements</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure the vehicle is comprehensively insured on the day of delivery until the end of your agreed contract date. We generally supply brand new unregistered cars. We will provide you with your registration plate details when we receive them, however we advise you to use the vehicle make, model and derivative to obtain insurance quotes. Your finance provider is the registered owner and keeper, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Pre-Registered Cars</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are some occasions where we sell new pre-registered vehicles. In these scenarios, we will make you aware of the date the vehicle was registered. It is your responsibility to ensure the vehicle remains serviced and maintained in line with the manufacturers’ guidelines. The warranty for pre-registered vehicles starts from the day of registration, NOT from the day of delivery. For example, if you have a three-year lease on a pre-registered vehicle registered a month before delivery, it will require an MOT certificate when it turns 3 years old - before the leasing agreement ends.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>Our Remuneration &amp; Commission Disclosure</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Nash Automotive Automotive Ltd trading as Nash Automotive Car Leasing is not independent, the service we provide is from a panel of carefully selected finance and vehicle supply partners. We will receive a payment or connected incentive from the parties involved in the transaction. The amount is determined by the nature of the contract and their measure of our operating standards and infrastructure.</p>
<p>We may also receive a rebate or payment from other suppliers. These payments may, along with quality service level agreements, influence where we place the order for your vehicle. They also affect the total amount payable in your agreement. Further information is available and can be provided prior to delivery in line with our standard calculation.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong> Manufacturer Price Protection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the Manufacturers pricing policy, your rental payment may be subject to change should the manufacturer increase the price of the vehicle before your vehicle has been delivered. We will advise of any amendments once the manufacturer has confirmed the final cost of the vehicle.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Is vehicle road tax included?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Depending on the type of leasing agreement you opt for, vehicle road tax will usually be included for either the first 12 months of the contract or the entire term. Your Account Manager will advise you on this prior to commitment to the leasing agreement. </span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Is car insurance included?</span></h3>
<p>In most cases, the answer is no. As part of the leasing agreement, it will be your responsibility to ensure that the car has fully comprehensive insurance for the length of the lease.</p>
<p>Once your car has been registered and we have a delivery date from the vehicle manufacturer, our Client Services Team will provide you with your new registration number so that you can arrange insurance to commence from the day of delivery. The delivery driver may want to see your insurance certificate before he can hand the vehicle over to you.</p>
<p>If you are buying your insurance online, often the registration of your new vehicle may not come up on the insurance database in advance of the car being registered and delivered.�&nbsp; If this is the case, please use the make and model of the car to obtain your insurance quotation.</p>
<p>We may be able to provide a vehicle which is fully insured, which is our <a href="/Nash Automotive-total-care/">Nash Automotive Total Care</a> product Please ask your Account Manager for details and a bespoke quotation on this.</p>
<p>We are not authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for the sale of vehicle insurance.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Do you provide GAP insurance?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">No. Nash Automotive Car Leasing does not offer GAP insurance. </span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What insurance is required?</span></h3>
<p>As part of the leasing agreement, the vehicle must have fully comprehensive insurance for the entire contract term.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Am I responsible for servicing the vehicle?</span></h3>
<p>Yes, all vehicles should be maintained and serviced in line with the manufacturer’s guidelines, as detailed in the vehicle handbook. In most cases, this can be done at your nearest main dealership or independent repairer using manufacturer parts, oils and lubricants.</p>
<p>For those with a maintenance plan, the majority of costs associated with servicing and mechanical repairs are included in your monthly payment. Maintenance plans vary by provider; your Account Manager will confirm what is included and what is not included at the quotation stage. To service your vehicle, contact your finance provider to book your appointment.�&nbsp; Check our <a href="/service-and-maintenance-guide/">Service and Maintenance Guide</a> to obtain the phone number or book online.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What is “Fair Wear and Tear”?</span></h3>
<p>The finance providers will expect your vehicle to be returned in line with their “Fair Wear and Tear” policy. Fair Wear and Tear occurs during normal use of the vehicle over time, but is different to damage, which will need to be rectified before the car is returned to avoid any charges from the leasing company.</p>
<p>Nash Automotive Car Leasing is a member of the BVRLA, the trade body for the vehicle rental and leasing body, and the BVRLA sets the Fair Wear and Tear guide which the industry uses for returned lease vehicles.�&nbsp; Please see the guide and our recommendations on our <a href="/fair-wear-and-tear-guide/">Fair Wear and Tear Guide</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">I don’t know what my yearly mileage will be…what should I do?</span></h3>
<p>There may be a number of reasons why you are unsure of your yearly mileage. For example, you may be changing roles, jobs or moving home, you could be given a different area of responsibility to work in or you may gain a new customer or business contact in a new area. Nash Automotive Car Leasing recommends looking at your distance mileage over the last two or three years and considering your personal circumstances and any other external factors which may affect how far you drive each year.</p>
<p>Our team are experienced in these conversations and are happy to help you select the right mileage for your contract. It is important to note that excess charges apply in the event that you exceed the contracted mileage.</p>
<p>After the first 12 months of your leasing agreement, if you think you are going to exceed your annual mileage, or are driving less miles than you thought, please contact your Account Manager or our Client Services Team and we may be able to provide a quotation for changing your contracted mileage (conditions apply).</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What would happen if I wanted to terminate my lease early?</span></h3>
<p>Lease agreements are fixed-term contracts therefore terminating them could mean you are liable to pay a charge and any excess mileage charges due at that point. This can be as much as 50-100% of any outstanding rentals. Please contact your Account Manager or our Client Services Team for a quote.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Does my vehicle come with the manufacturer’s warranty?</span></h3>
<p>Yes, all new and pre-registered vehicles benefit from the manufacturer’s warranty. These may differ between brands. Please discuss this with your Account Manager who will be happy to provide the warranty details and benefits for the various makes and models.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">How is the residual value of the vehicle calculated?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Leasing companies use a variety of factors to estimate the residual value of your vehicle at the end of the lease. This includes information from the vehicle manufacturer, auction prices and historical resale data as well as market trends and changes in tax legislation including, for example, CO2 tax and Benefit in Kind (BIK) tax.</span></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">BUSINESS AND PERSONAL LEASING</h2>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What is the difference between a personal lease and a business lease?</span></h3>
<p>If you are a private individual with no access to a car allowance, business mileage payment or a company provided vehicle, then you will require a personal leasing agreement which is know as Personal Contract Hire (PCH).�&nbsp; You will be responsible for the contract payments and the contract will be in your name.</p>
<p>If you have access to a company car or a car allowance to opt-out of your company car scheme, our team are here to talk you through the advantages and disadvantages of a business versus a personal lease.</p>
<p>If you own or work in a business which offers company cars as part of your requirements of your role or as part of your benefits package, then a business leasing agreement, Business Contract Hire (BCH), will be a contract in the name of the business, and the business will be responsible for the monthly payments.�&nbsp; Drivers of company cars are subject to benefit-in-kind tax which will deducted directly from the individual’s salary in most cases.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">FUNDING YOUR VEHICLE</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Who provides the funding to finance my car?</span></h3>
<p>Nash Automotive Car Leasing has built strong, trusted relationships with major manufacturers and vehicle suppliers. Our business volume ensures we obtain the very best terms, vehicle availability and purchase allocations. We work with a carefully selected panel of blue-chip vehicle finance providers including Alphabet, Arval, Lex Autolease, Leaseplan, ALD, Novuna, Leasys, Santander, RCI, Kinto and Volkswagen Financial Services (VWFS).</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Are there any hidden costs</span><span data-mce-mark="1">?</span></h3>
<p>No, there are no hidden costs. Nash Automotive Car Leasing applies a vehicle sourcing charge from £225 + VAT. If there are any other fees associated with your agreement, these charges will be clearly identified on the written quotation. It’s important to note that you will not own the vehicle, and excess mileage charges may apply at the end of the contract if you exceed your mileage allowance.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">How much should I put down as an initial payment?</span></h3>
<p>Your initial payment can be flexible depending on your circumstances, and normally would be the equivalent of between one- and twelve-months’ leasing payments for your chosen vehicle. The higher the initial payment, the lower the regular monthly payments. However, it is important to note that the total amount payable over the term of the leasing agreement will remain the same whichever contract configuration you choose.�&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Is my initial payment returned to me at the end of the lease? </span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">No, your initial payment is not returned as it forms part of the overall cost of the leasing agreement. </span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">How much is the Vehicle Sourcing Charge and why do I need to pay it?</span></h3>
<p>The Vehicle Sourcing Charge is from £225+VAT and it covers the cost of our sourcing your vehicle and the administration in providing you with your finance agreement.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">When will the first monthly payment leave my bank account?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Your first monthly payment is normally taken by the leasing company approximately one month after delivery of your vehicle. Payment is made by direct debit.�&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">When must my initial rental be made?</span></h3>
<p>When your initial rental is taken will depend on your individual finance provider, as they can operate slightly differently.�&nbsp; Your initial rental will be taken by direct debit as a one-off payment and you will be made aware of when the initial payment is due by your finance provider.</p>
<p>Depending on your finance provider, the payment may be taken either slightly before or after delivery.�&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Why do I need a good credit rating?</span></h3>
<p>In order to qualify for our leasing contracts, you will need to be accepted by one of our financial providers. They normally look for a “good” or “excellent” credit rating to protect themselves from risk and ensure that all the payments on the lease vehicle will be made, as per the leasing agreement. If you have any concerns about your credit rating, please chat this through with your Account Manager at an early stage in the process.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">ORDERING YOUR VEHICLE</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What are the advantages of leasing with Nash Automotive Car Leasing?</span></h3>
<p>Nash Automotive Car Leasing has been established since 2006 and we are proud of our friendly and professional approach. We offer a <a href="/best-price-guarantee/">Best Price Guarantee</a> and we've achieved the Platinum Trusted Service Award for consecutive years from global feedback engine, Feefo. We are focussed on offering a great leasing experience for our clients. You can read our independently verified <a href="/reviews/">reviews on Feefo</a> by visiting our Reviews section and see why we're rated 5 Stars for Customer Experience.<span data-mce-mark="1"><a href="/reviews/"></a></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">How long will my vehicle take to arrive?</span></h3>
<p>How long your vehicle takes to arrive will depend on a number of factors. Factory orders can take from 6 weeks to over 12 months to be ready for delivery. Where possible, we will offer <a href="/in-stock-lease-deals/">stock vehicle deals</a> which can be delivered in as little as 7 to 10 days. �&nbsp;�&nbsp;This is dependent on finance approval, signed finance documentation, identity checks (driving licence) and the availability of delivery dates from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Let us know what timescales you need to work to in order to have your vehicle delivered, and we will be happy to try and accommodate you wherever possible.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Do I need to collect my car?</span></h3>
<p>No, in most cases we offer free mainland UK delivery of your vehicle to you home address for personal contract hire agreements, and to your business address for business contract hire agreements. �&nbsp;The vehicle will be driven to you from our supplier. Should you prefer your vehicle to be transporter delivered, please ask our Client Services Team if this is possible and they will advise you if there are any associated costs.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Where do you deliver vehicles to?</span></h3>
<p>All our vehicles include free mainland UK delivery to your home address for personal leasing agreements and to your business address for business leasing agreements.�&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">I’ve placed an order but I want to cancel it….what do I do?</span></h3>
<p>If you wish to cancel your order, please inform us by telephone, email or in writing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>By signing our contract or accepting our terms of business by text you agree for Nash Automotive Car Leasing to start sourcing a vehicle for you immediately.�&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a regulated agreement (e.g. you are a private individual, a sole trader or a partnership with up to 3 partners) and choose to cancel your vehicle order, you will be liable for the costs of any service delivered which will be equal to one month’s rental (+VAT) of the vehicle ordered, and in addition our vehicle sourcing charge is non-refundable if you choose to cancel your order for any reason after 14 days of the point of order.�&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a non-regulated agreement (e.g. a business which is a limited company, PLC, a partnership with 4 or more partners), and choose to cancel it, you will be liable for the costs of any service delivered which will be equal to three months’ rental (+VAT) of the vehicle ordered, and in addition our vehicle sourcing charge is non-refundable if you choose to cancel your order for any reason at any time.�&nbsp; Please refer to our full terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Please note, cancellation charges may also apply to your finance agreement. Please ensure that you read and understand the terms and conditions of your finance agreement. We require at least 48 hours’ notice if you wish to change or cancel your delivery/collection, otherwise charges may be incurred.</p>
<p>If your finance application is not approved, we’ll refund the Vehicle Sourcing Charge and any applicable holding deposit paid and there will be no further cost to you.</p>
<p>For short-term lease and daily rental vehicles, cancellation charges will apply if the vehicle is returned prior to the minimum contract agreement.�&nbsp; There will be a cancellation charge of £100+VAT per vehicle plus any outstanding days’ rental owed at the lower rate if applicable.</p>
<p>Your order will only be confirmed on receipt of the signed quotation/order form, you finance application has been approved, and payment of the vehicle sourcing charge as well as any applicable holding deposit has been received.�&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5;" data-mce-mark="1">Do you offer part-exchange?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">No, we do not offer part-exchange. </span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Do you sell or lease used cars?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">If you're looking to lease a used car, Nash Automotive has a variety of options to consider. Our <a href="/used-car-leasing/">used car lease deals</a> offer great value and are available for both business and personal leasing contracts.�&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What makes of car do you lease?</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">We are able to source the majority of makes and models available in the UK. Search our <a href="/">website</a> for details or <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> and we'll call you back to discuss your requirements.�&nbsp;</span><a><span data-mce-mark="1"><br></span></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Is breakdown cover / roadside assistance included?</span></h3>
<p>Breakdown cover is often included by the manufacturer for at least the first year of the warranty, depending on the specific make of your vehicle. Your Account Manager will be able to confirm this with you prior to commitment to the lease.�&nbsp; If you opt for including a service and maintenance agreement, breakdown and roadside assistance is included for the term of your lease.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Can I add private number plates to my lease car?</span></h3>
<p>Yes, this is fine, subject to leasing company acceptance. We can arrange for private number plates to be added to your vehicle prior to delivery. Please inform your Account Manager or our Client Services Team as early in the process as possible as this can take 3-4 weeks to arrange. Nash Automotive Car Leasing will be happy to organise this for you at no additional charge, however, please note that the leasing company may make an administration charge for adding and/or removing private number plates.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Do you offer a national delivery service?</span></h3>
<p>We offer free UK mainland delivery to your home address for personal leasing agreements, and to the named business address for business leases.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Where are you based? </span></h3>
<p>Nash Automotive Car Leasing’s head office is based at Hornbeam Park in the beautiful spa town of Harrogate, North Yorkshire.</p>
<p>We are a national company, and we supply lease vehicles anywhere in mainland UK. The car is normally delivered directly from the manufacturer to your home or office address.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.5;">Why can't I obtain an insurance quote for my new vehicle - the registration plate number is not being recognised?</span></h3>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Sometimes car insurance websites will not recognise your new vehicle registration plate because the vehicle is only registered shortly before it is delivered. You should be able to choose the make and model of the vehicle instead of the registration plate and obtain an insurance quote that way. Please give our Client Services Team a call if you need any more help.</span></p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">DURING YOUR LEASING TERM: IN-LIFE HELP AND SUPPORT</span></h2>
<h3><span data-mce-mark="1">Where can I take my car for servicing?</span></h3>
<p>Your vehicle must be maintained in line with the manufacturer’s guidelines. This can be done at either your nearest main dealership or by an independent repairer using manufacturer parts, and approved oils and lubricants.�&nbsp; If you have a maintenance and servicing plan, <strong>phone your finance provider or go onto their website (or your maintenance provider if this is a separate plan) to book your car in for servicing</strong>.�&nbsp; If you don’t have a maintenance and service plan, you can also contact your finance provider and they will be able to let you know your nearest approved garage to get your car serviced.�&nbsp; You can find a list of phone numbers to call in our <a href="/service-and-maintenance-guide/">Service and Maintenance Guide</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>When does my car require a service? </strong></h3>
<p>Each manufacturer and model will have a different service requirement.�&nbsp; In many cases, the car will indicate that a service is due on its dashboard.</p>
<p>If you are unsure of your car’s service requirements, contact your finance provider or your local manufacture dealership who will be able to provide you with the information.</p>
<p>It is the driver’s responsibility to ensure that servicing is carried out in line with the manufacturer’s guidelines.</p>
<p>If you have a maintenance and service plan, contact your finance provider or maintenance provider to book your car in to your local approved dealership workshop. �&nbsp;This can be done online or via phone.�&nbsp; You can gain your finance provider’s contact details from our <a href="/service-and-maintenance-guide/">Service and Maintenance Guide.</a></p>
<p>We advise you to keep any paperwork from your vehicle’s servicing to be returned with your vehicle.</p>
<p>Any missed servicing could result in end of contract charges by your finance provider.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">I have a maintenance plan….how do I get my tyres changed?</span></h3>
<p>Depending on the type of maintenance plan you have opted for, most tyres can be replaced by several nationwide tyre companies, including <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.kwik-fit.com" target="_blank"><span data-mce-mark="1">Kwik Fit</span></a><span data-mce-mark="1">, </span><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.atseuromaster.co.uk/consumer/" target="_blank"><span data-mce-mark="1">ATS</span></a><span data-mce-mark="1"> and </span><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.national.co.uk/" target="_blank"><span data-mce-mark="1">National Tyres</span></a>, with depots all over the country as well as mobile repair units.�&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You should phone your finance provider or log onto their website</strong>, (or if you have a separate policy call your maintenance provider) and they will confirm which tyre company to go to.�&nbsp; When arriving at the tyre depot, state who your finance/maintenance provider is so they can gain authorisation for the work.</p>
<p>Different finance and maintenance providers have different tyre cover, so you should confirm the tyre policy with your finance provide by calling them directly before booking in your vehicle for repair.�&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be provided with a “Driver Welcome Pack” with details of your finance provider, or you can access their details on our <a href="/service-and-maintenance-guide/">Service and Maintenance Guide</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to follow your finance and/or maintenance provider’s policy for changing tyres, as if this policy is not followed it may mean that the cost of the tyre is not covered under your maintenance plan.�&nbsp; This means going to an approved provider and informing them of your maintenance plan before any work is carried out.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What is included in my maintenance plan?</span></h3>
<p>Maintenance plans vary by provider. Your Account Manager can talk you through the options available and provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Please phone or go online to your finance/maintenance provider to book your vehicle in for routine <a href="/service-and-maintenance-guide/">servicing and maintenance</a> so you can be sure that the work done will be covered by your provider and it will be carried out at an approved garage.�&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">My car has broken down…what do I do?</span></h3>
<p>In many cases, roadside assistance will be provided by the vehicle manufacturer for either the first year of the contract or up to approximately three years. �&nbsp;Please check your “Driver Welcome Pack” or Vehicle Handbook or see our <a href="/service-and-maintenance-guide/">Service and Maintenance Guide</a> and call the Breakdown Recovery/Roadside Assistance number.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a maintenance plan, call your finance or maintenance provider in the event of a breakdown</strong> and they will put you straight through to a breakdown company such as the RAC or AA.</p>
<p><strong>We always recommend saving your finance provider and/or maintenance provider number in your mobile phone</strong> should you need it in an emergency.�&nbsp; If you do not have a maintenance plan, check your manufacturer’s roadside assistance terms and consider buying your own breakdown cover if the manufacturer does not cover the full term of your lease.</p>
<h3><strong>There is a warning light on my vehicle...what do I do?</strong></h3>
<p>If provided in your vehicle, check your vehicle handbook to identify the warning light.</p>
<p>In most cases, a red warning letter indicates the car should not be driven, and an amber light is an advisory warning, which should be investigated by a dealership garage as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If the vehicle is safe to continue to drive, contact your finance provider who will advise of your nearest approved garage for the car to be booked into, inspected and fixed.�&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the car is not safe to drive, ensure you exit the vehicle safely and contact your finance provider, vehicle manufacturer or maintenance provider for breakdown recovery.</p>
<p>If your car does not have a maintenance plan and its manufacturer’s roadside assistance has expired, you will need to organise your own recovery from a local provider, unless you have previously organised your own breakdown cover separately.</p>
<p>You can find the contact details of your finance provider and vehicle manufacturer on our <a href="/service-and-maintenance-guide/">Service and Maintenance Guide.</a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">I have exceeded my yearly mileage …what are my options?</span></h3>
<p>If you have exceeded your yearly mileage, or think that this is likely, please call our Client Services Team or drop them an email on <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#46252a2f232832352334302f25233506353f282334213f2527342a2327352f282168252968332d"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="492a25202c273d3a2c3b3f202a2c3a093a30272c3b2e302a283b252c283a20272e672a26673c22">[email�&nbsp;protected]</span></a> �&nbsp;Our Client Services Team will be happy to discuss the options available and calculate the excess mileage charge to date, to estimate what you might have to pay at the end of the agreement. There may also be the option of re-contracting your vehicle based on the higher mileage.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">I’ve had an accident in my vehicle…what do I do?</span></h3>
<p>In the first instance, please <strong>contact your insurance company</strong> and inform your finance provider. �&nbsp;Please contact Nash Automotive Car Leasing at a convenient time after the accident. Please give our Client Services Team a call or email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dfbcb3b6bab1abacbaada9b6bcbaac9faca6b1baadb8a6bcbeadb3babeacb6b1b8f1bcb0f1aab4"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1d7e71747873696e786f6b747e786e5d6e6473786f7a647e7c6f71787c6e74737a337e72336876">[email�&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p>
<p>Check any documentation provided by your insurance company and leasing company regarding the policies and procedures to follow in case of an accident, and keep them with you in your vehicle at all times.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">What if my vehicle is written off?</span></h3>
<p>If your vehicle is written off or involved in an accident during the term of the lease, you must <strong>inform your insurance company and finance provider. </strong>�&nbsp;You should also inform Nash Automotive Car Leasing by contacting our Client Services Team by phone or by email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6506090c000b11160017130c06001625161c0b0017021c060417090004160c0b024b060a4b100e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e586898c808b91968097938c868096a5969c8b8097829c868497898084968c8b82cb868acb908e">[email�&nbsp;protected]</span></a> You must make sure your vehicle has fully comprehensive insurance throughout the term of the lease.�&nbsp; Your Account Manager will also be able to help to source you a replacement vehicle once the claim has been settled between with your insurance company and leasing company.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">I want to take my lease car abroad…what documentation should I take with me?</span></h3>
<p>You are required to inform your finance provider if you wish to take your car abroad so that they can issue you with a “Vehicle on Hire” (VE103) certificate.</p>
<p>Make sure you allow plenty of time to receive the certificate by post - there will be a small charge for this.</p>
<p>Make sure you have European Breakdown Cover and that this covers you for repatriation of the car to the UK should it suffer significant damage and cannot be fixed abroad. Make sure your fully comprehensive insurance also covers you for travelling abroad, and that you comply with all legal requirements of the country or countries you are travelling in.</p>
<p>You can find more specific advice and links to further information from: <a href="http://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad">www.gov.uk/driving-abroad</a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">I have not taken out a maintenance package….where do I take my car for servicing?</span></h3>
<p>You are required to ensure your vehicle is maintained in line with the manufacturer’s requirements. Most cars can either be taken to your nearest main dealership for routine servicing or an independent repairer using manufacturer parts, and approved oils and lubricants.�&nbsp; <strong>Please call your finance provider</strong> who will be able to let you know the nearest approved garage.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Can I modify or add accessories to my vehicle?</span></h3>
<p>In most cases you can modify the vehicle providing the accessory can be removed from the vehicle prior to collection at the end of the lease, and it does leave any lasting damage. You cannot permanently change the vehicle.�&nbsp; You should always check with your finance provider before you go ahead with any changes.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Can I change to a new car during the term of my lease?</span></h3>
<p>If you wish to terminate a lease and take out a new lease on another vehicle, there may be early termination charges to pay, which can be anything from 50%-100% of the outstanding rentals. Speak to your Account Manager who will advise you of your options and can arrange an early termination quotation.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">How do I end my contract early?</span></h3>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Please get in contact with us if you want to end your leasing agreement before the end of the contract, as early termination charges may apply which can be 50%-100% of any outstanding rentals.

<h2 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">COMING TO THE END OF THE LEASE </span></h2>
<h3><span style="line-height: 1.3;" data-mce-mark="1">My current lease is coming to an end…what do I do?</span></h3>
<p>We advise you start thinking about your next leasing vehicle six to nine months prior to your current agreement ending. Our Client Services Team will be in touch to remind you of the end date of your current contract. Speak to your Account Manager at least six to nine months in advance of the end date of your current contract, so we can advise you of lead times for your next vehicle of choice. We work towards delivering your next vehicle on the day your current agreement ends. Where possible, we will also arrange for your existing vehicle to be collected on the same day.</p>
<p>Post-Covid lockdowns, lead times globally for cars and vans are much longer than previously due to the internationally connected supply chain.�&nbsp; If you are considering a very specific vehicle, then we advise you to get in touch with us up to 12 months in advance of the end of your lease so we check current lead times for you.</p>
<p>It also worth checking that your current vehicle is up to date on service and maintenance, and to check the industry standard <a href="/fair-wear-and-tear-guide/">Fair Wear and Tear</a> policy to allow plenty of time should any minor repairs need to be made before the contract ends.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Can I purchase my car at the end of the lease term?</span></h3>
<p>In most cases you will not be able to purchase the car, although this can be at the discretion of the finance provider. The advantages of leasing mean that, in most cases, the car is simply handed back at the end of the term and a new vehicle is leased under a new contract.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Can I extend my contract at the end of the lease term? </span></h3>
<p>In certain circumstances this may be possible depending on the type of agreement, the finance provider and whether the agreement is regulated or non-regulated. Please contact our Client Services Team or your Account Manager to chat this through, and where possible we will facilitate this and provide you with a quotation for your extension from your finance provider.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">Do I own the vehicle at the end of the lease term?</span></h3>
<p>No, you will not own the car. The advantages of leasing mean that, in most cases, the car is simply handed back at the end of the term and a new vehicle is leased under a new contract.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span data-mce-mark="1">How is my vehicle returned at the end of the contract?</span></h3>
<p>Your vehicle will be collected from an address of your choice, and this will be arranged with you in advance. The vehicle must meet <a href="/fair-wear-and-tear-guide/">Fair Wear and Tear guidelines</a> and not have any warning lights on.�&nbsp; It should also be clean inside and out as the car will be checked over on collection.</p>

<h2>Salary Sacrifice Car Leasing Scheme</h2>
<h3>Do you offer a salary sacrifice car leasing scheme?</h3>
<p>At Nash Automotive we do offer a salary sacrifice car leasing scheme. In order to secure your salary sacrifice car, it must go through your employer’s salary sacrifice scheme.</p>
<h3>What is a salary sacrifice scheme?</h3>
<p>A salary sacrifice car leasing scheme works by essentially ‘sacrificing’ part of an employee’s gross salary in exchange for a tax efficient, non-cash benefit. An employee can take advantage of this scheme by having a fixed monthly amount deducted from their gross salary and in exchange, they can receive a <span>fully electric or hybrid vehicle (less than 75g/km of CO2). If you opt for a salary sacrifice lease car, this offers your business and your employees significant savings and benefits.</span></p>
<h3>What are the benefits of a salary sacrifice scheme?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Potential for significant savings for both the employee and the employer on income tax and national insurance</li>
<li>Improves your Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) contribution and supports your sustainability goals</li>
<li>Great staff benefit to attract and retain your best talent<br><br></li>
</ul>
<p>At Nash Automotive we offer a ‘white glove’ approach which means we will tailor your quote to suit your business needs. You can choose from a wide range of brand-new vehicles on a 2, 3 or 4 year agreement which you simply hand back at the end of the contact.</p>
