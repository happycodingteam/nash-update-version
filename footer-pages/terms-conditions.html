Our Services are described in more detail in our initial disclosure document. <br>1.2 These Terms do not cover the actual leasing of the vehicle to you or the provision of financing – this will be dealt with under a separate hire agreement and these Terms are only intended to cover our provision of the Services described in section 1.1 above.<br>1.3 Normally we act as a credit broker, not a funder. Where we are acting as a funder, this will be made clear to you before you sign any hire agreement.<br>1.4 Please read these Terms carefully before you purchase Services from us. These Terms tell you who we are, how we will provide the Services to you, how you and we may change or end the Contract, what to do if there is a problem with your order and other important information.<br>1.5 These Terms shall apply whether you are purchasing from us as a Consumer or a Business Customer (as defined below). If you are purchasing from us as a Consumer, you will have certain different rights under these Terms than our Business Customers. Where certain provisions apply only to either Consumers or Business Customers, this is clearly stated.</p>

<p><strong>4. OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU</strong><br>4.1 When you make an enquiry with us regarding our Services, we will provide you with a written quotation. If you come back to us and confirm that our quotation is acceptable, you are making an order to purchase our Services. Our acceptance of your order will take place when we email you to accept it and we send you a vehicle order form, at which point a contract will come into existence between you and us ("<strong>the Contract</strong>”) and these Terms will become legally binding on you and us.</p>
<p>4.2 If we are unable to accept your order, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for our Services. There are various reasons why we might be unable to accept your order, including if you do not pass our ID checks, if you do not pass a finance providers credit checks or if the vehicle you want is no longer available. However, we are free at our sole discretion to accept or reject any order that you place with us.</p>

You will not be entitled to a refund, nor will we be liable to you in any other way, if we are unable to find a vehicle which meets your requirements or find a suitable financing option for you. However, we may offer a refund if we find you a vehicle which then becomes unavailable (and you do not want a different vehicle) or you do not pass the finance provider checks. <br>5.3 If you believe there is a problem with our Services, you may have certain rights and these are set out in section 9.<br>5.4 We will search for, and provide you with options of, vehicles and financing arrangements which we believe meet the specifications you provide to us.

We will receive a commission payment from the parties involved in the transaction should you decide to enter into an agreement with them.<br>6.2 We are paid a commission which may be pre-set but can vary by finance provider, and may affect the amount payable by you and the amount of the vehicle’s monthly rental.�&nbsp;<br>6.3 If you are a regulated customer (private individual, sole trader or small partnership with 2-3 partners), and before the finance agreement is set live, you have the right to request the disclosure of any applicable commission we earn on your finance agreement.<br>6.4 To request this, please email�&nbsp;<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#583b373528343139363b3d182b21363d2a3f213b392a343d392b31363f763b37762d33"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a4c7cbc9d4c8cdc5cac7c1e4d7ddcac1d6c3ddc7c5d6c8c1c5d7cdcac38ac7cb8ad1cf">[email�&nbsp;protected]</span></a>, call us on 0333 920 1545 or you can write to us at: Nash Car Leasing, Hornbeam Park Oval, Hornbeam Park, Harrogate HG2 8RB.</p>
<p><strong>7. WHEN AND HOW WE CHARGE YOU</strong><br>7.1 The amount payable by you in respect of our vehicle sourcing fee will be stated in the quotation we send to you when we receive your enquiry, so it is clearly identified to you prior to any commitment by you to purchase our Services.<br>7.2 When we send you our vehicle order form on acceptance of your order, we will also send you a payment link so that you can make payment of our vehicle sourcing fee (and if you are a Business Customer, shall also provide you with an invoice). The vehicle sourcing fee is the fee payable by you, to us, in consideration of us providing the Services to you. <br>7.3 Where you wish to engage us to provide any additional services to you, such as extension of a current financing agreement, we may charge you an additional fee. Again, this will be clearly identified to you prior to any commitment by you to purchase any additional services from us.<br>7.4 If you are required by a third party finance provider or vehicle supplier to pay a holding deposit to secure a vehicle, we may require you to pay before we are able to order your vehicle.<br>7.5 If the rate of VAT changes at any time during which we are providing the Services to you, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.</p>

<p><br><em><strong>Section 9.2 applies to Consumers only</strong></em><br><strong>9.2 Your rights and remedies if you are a Consumer.</strong> We honour our legal duty to consumers to provide our Services with reasonable skill and care and we extend that duty to all Consumers who purchase Services from us. <br>The Consumer Rights Act 2015 says that if you are a consumer purchasing services, you have the following legal rights:<br>(a) You can ask us to repeat or fix a service if it is not carried out with reasonable skill and care, or get some money back if we can’t fix it.<br>(b) If a time hasn’t been agreed upfront, it must be carried out within a reasonable time.<br>These rights are subject to certain exceptions.

<p>13.1 We don’t compensate you for all losses caused by us or our Services. If you are a Consumer, we are responsible for losses you suffer caused by us breaking a Contract unless the loss is:<br>(a) Unexpected, i.e. it was not obvious that it would happen and nothing you said to us before we accepted your order meant we should have expected it (so, in the law, the loss was unforeseeable).<br>(b) caused by a delaying event outside our control. As long as we have taken the steps set out in the section, we're not responsible for any delays outside of our control.<br>(c) avoidable. Something you could have avoided by taking reasonable action.<br>(d) a business loss. Our liability for any loss you suffer in connection with your trade, craft or profession is limited as described in section 13.2 (Our liability to Business Customers).<br>Section 13.2 applies to Business Customer only<br>13.2 If you are a Business Customer then, except in respect of the losses described in section 13.3 which we never limit or exclude:<br>(a) we shall not be liable to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, for any loss of profit, or any indirect or consequential loss arising under or in connection with any Contract between us; and<br>(b) our total liability to you for all other losses arising under or in connection with any Contract between us, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise shall be limited to the total fees paid by you, to us, under or in accordance with this agreement.<br>13.3 There are some losses that we never limit or exclude. Nothing in these Terms shall limit or exclude our liability for:<br>(a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence, or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors (as applicable);<br>(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;<br>(c) breach of the terms implied by section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982; or<br>(d) any other matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict liability.</p>

<p><br><strong>15. YOUR OPTIONS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES WITH US</strong><br>15.1 <strong>Our complaints policy.</strong> We will do our best to resolve any problems you have with us or our Services as per our Complaints Handling Process: https://www.Nashcarleasing.co.uk/complaints/15.2 Raise a complaint.

<p><br><em><strong>Section 15.3 applies to Consumers only</strong></em> <br>15.3 <strong>Resolving disputes without going to court.</strong> Alternative dispute resolution is an optional process where an independent body considers the facts of the dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. You may be eligible to refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service and the British Vehicle Rental &amp; Leasing Association. Details of how to do this are available in our Complaints Policy: <br>https://www.Nashcarleasing.co.uk/complaints/.</p>
<p>15.4 <strong>You can go to court</strong>. These Terms are governed by English law. If you are a Consumer then, wherever you live, you can bring claims against us in the English Courts and if you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, you can also bring claims against us in the courts of the country you live in. If you are a Business Customer, you irrevocably agree to submit all disputes arising out of or in connection with our Contract with you to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.</p>
<p><br><strong>16. OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS WHICH APPLY TO OUR CONTRACT</strong><br>16.1 We may transfer our Contract with you, so that a different organisation is responsible for supplying the Services to you. We’ll tell you in writing if this happens and, if you are a Consumer, we’ll ensure that the transfer won’t affect your rights under the Contract. <br>16.2 You can only transfer your Contract with us to someone else if we agree to this in writing. <br>16.3 This Contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms and neither of us will need to ask anybody else to sign-off on ending or changing it.<br>16.4 If a court or other authority decides that some of these Terms are unlawful, the rest will continue to apply.<br>16.5 Even if we delay in enforcing the Contract, we can still enforce it later. We might not immediately chase you for not doing something (like paying) or for doing something you are not allowed to, but that doesn’t mean we can’t do it later.</p>
